Some useful git scripts to make easier some daily operations.

Note that they are dependent of:

- The naming schema used for moodle branches (MOODLE_XX_STABLE)
- My naming schema used for feature branches (_21, _22...)

But surely they can be easily hacked to suit your needs.

To install them:

- clone/download the repository.
- add it to your $PATH.
- create git aliases for them if you're really lazy or
  you aren't using autocompletion.

Then you'll be able to run:

- git currentbranch: returns the current branch.
- git currentcommit: returns the current commit (in current branch).
- git oldest-ancestor: returns the oldest common ancestor
      (branch point) of two given branches.
- git package: given a commit/tag/branch, one format
      (zip, tar, tgz), one target directory and one prefix
      generate one package containing that exact version
      from any git repository. When a prefix is defined,
      support for both including and excluding files is
      enabled if prefix.included or prefix.excluded files
      are present in the git dir. See git-package-moodle-prefix
      for a working example prefix). Examples:
        - git package
        - git package v2.2.3 --format=tgz --prefix=moodle
        - git package MOODLE_22_STABLE --dir=/some/dir --prefix=moodle
        - git package v2.1.0 -f tar -d /some/dir -p moodle
        - git package 53cd3c286e8ac0b368fa6becb113945f292891cc
        - git package v2.4.0-rc1 --branch MOODLE_24_STABLE (or --branch master, the default)

- git pullall: pulls all the upstream branches.
- git mrproper: detects all the feature branches already
      merged/picked upstream, suggesting the git command
      to execute in order to get rid of them.

And that's all. Enjoy them!
